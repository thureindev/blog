## You know nothing, ThuRein.
  As a rookie blogger, I'm not sure neithr how to write an interesting blog nor how to set the scope. As I've mentioned in my [Welcome to my blog](../welcome), I wanted to set the scope to tech related. Because I don't want to just throw everything and become an online diary or something. Yet I want to keep the sentences conversational, use techinical terms only when necessary and make everything easy to understand.
  
  How about reading duration? Should I set it to 3mins? 10mins? 20mins? Does it depend on the topic? Does it depend on the audience? Who are my audience?

  So many questions to find answers myself. And I believe it's going to take time. As far as I've learned, writing is a soft skill. There is no exact formula to become a good writer. Although there are learnable techniques and practicing helps.

  I ask myself why am I struggling to start writing a blog. I worked as a programming tutor. So sharing what I know should not be that much difficult. I realized it was just my delusion. I thought I could write perfectly. I had some good grades in essays during highschool. That made me delusional about my writing skills. The unknown unknwon is more dangerous than known unknown, right?

  Now, the first step in correcting a mistake is realizing there is a mistake. I have to accept that I am not good at writing. And I have to learn a lot and practice a lot.

  Forwarded the first step in learning how to blog.
